Hotel Management necessitates a thorough understanding of distribution strategy, finance, customer service, staff management,
and marketing, among other things. 
It can include various components within itself such as Guest Management, Rooms Management, Desk Billing, Housekeeping Service Management, etc. 
In this project, we have emphasized upon Front Desk Management of a hotel and have included the following elements in our system.
1. Employee Management
2. Room Management & Guest Management
3. Restaurant Management
4. Scheduling Activities of Hotel

In order to implement these constituents, we have made use of several data structures such as Trees, Graphs, Tries and Linked Lists.
In addition to making efficient and smart use of these data structures and associated algorithms, 
we have integrated file management into a number of components.
